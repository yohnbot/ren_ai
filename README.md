Using this plugin for Vtube Studio to listen to the desktop audio to sync animation with the mouth of the avatar

Future improvements that can be done for this project as it is out of scope:
- Update TTS
- Fully intergrate with Twitch and Youtube
- Include animations depending on the feelings such as happy, sad and crying as there are lots of emotions to convey.
